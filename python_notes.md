##Intro: Programming and Hardware Architecture
The course is a gateway do Data Analytics and Machine Learning.

**Computers**: Software + Hardware
**Programming** is giving instructions to the computer, so a *program* is a set of instructions.

**Basic Block for Hardware Diagram:** 
- CPU: runs the program.
- Main Memory: volatile storage.
- Secondary Memory: permanent storage. If you look at old secondary memories you'd have a spinning hard drive working with magnetics and electronics.
 - I/O Devices.
 
 Devices are getting smaller and smaller, they need to be cooled down.
 
 **Python:** gets translated into Machine Language and then runs on the CPU.
